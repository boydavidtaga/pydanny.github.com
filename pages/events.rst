===========

For years, I got the chance to travel to and talk at events all over the world. I don't get to enjoy this priviledge any longer, but below are lists of what I did.

June 2016: PyCon Singapore
==================================

With `Audrey Roy Greenfeld`_, I co-presented a keynote speech called Overscaling to Negative Infinity and co-taught a tutorial on Django best practices.



May 2016: PyCon US
==================================

I was at PyCon with `Audrey Roy Greenfeld`_ running the Cookiecutter_ booth during the main conference days and later at the Cookiecutter_ sprints.
