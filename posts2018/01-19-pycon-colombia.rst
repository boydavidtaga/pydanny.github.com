We'll be arriving in Medellin late evening on February 7th and staying a while longer after the conference so we can have the time to explore the lovely city of Medellin_. We're very excited, because travel is a rarity for us now and Medellin (and the surrounding area) is supposed to be quite beautiful. Plus, all the Colombians we know online are excellent people - we can't wait to meet them!

Our hope is that on the day(s) after `PyCon Colombia`_ we can see the sights and eat the foods with Colombians who know Medellin. So let me know if you want to meet up!

Hasta pronto!
