Last year on April 1st `I wrote how the next Two Scoops Press book would be about goblins`_. Naturally, many interpreted this as an April Fool's Day prank. Also naturally, I didn't agree or disagree with this interpretation of my blog post.

Well, it's time to unveil the the punchline, as it were, for last year's April Fool's Day post. Are you ready for it? Here goes...

The punchline is that blog post wasn't a joke or prank. Indeed, yesterday I released my first fiction book, a dark fantasy novel with goblins in it.

Description:

*The world was ancient, scarred from a thousand wars between gods, immortals, and heroes. Old grudges have faded but are not forgotten.*

*At the end of a so-called ‘age of peace’, two great nations of immortals march against each other, with humanity caught in the middle. In this world of conflict, three very different individuals are thrust into the face of danger.*

*Here a young man is marched off to war, a noble woman takes charge of her own destiny, and in the depths of the Haunted Lands a dark king is born. Their fates will shake the foundations of the universe.*

If you would like to buy my book, you can do so on Amazon_ for the introductory price of $2.99, the same price as a cup of coffee in the USA. The book is also in the Kindle Unlimited program, at least for now.

Finally, as mentioned in my blog post last year, I've moved most of my fiction writing based articles to my author blog at `danielroygreenfeld.com`_.
