&lt;div class="section" id="whats-the-coolest-thing-you-discovered-this-year"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s the Coolest Thing You Discovered This Year?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex had his own focused on Python applications, frameworks, and libraries. Me, I'm going for a more general approach. This year I discovered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="latex"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;LaTeX&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That &lt;a class="reference external" href="django.2scoops.org"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; I co-wrote with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://audreyr.com"&gt;Audrey Roy&lt;/a&gt;? Written in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX"&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt;. It wasn't easy to get started, even with Audrey as my instructor, but now that I grok it, I feel extremely empowered. That's because I can do all kinds of awesome, insane hacks when &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sphinx-doc.org/"&gt;Sphinx&lt;/a&gt; generates PDFs. I hope I get the chance to show off some of my new madness to the world in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-to-tie-a-bow-tie"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to Tie A Bow Tie&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are going to be formal, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_tie"&gt;bow tie&lt;/a&gt; adds an enormous amount of class. However, clip-ons are considered tacky, especially as it's considered stylish to loosen the bow tie later in the evening to demonstrate you aren't wearing that clip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the stuff I watched on the subject of bow tying, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5PTLV-L_sk"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; was the longest and the best of them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 1/4/2014:&lt;/strong&gt; I learned this awesome skill because &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pydanny.com/i-married-audrey-roy.html"&gt;I wanted to be classy on my wedding day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="awesome-foods-around-the-world"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Awesome Foods Around the World&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the short-list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscypek"&gt;Oscypek&lt;/a&gt; is a Polish smoked, salted cheese that should be exported to the universe. Seriously. If you get some, grill it and serve with jelly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Florence, Italy you can eat Duck Carpaccio and it is heavenly. If there is ever a reason to visit Florence, it is Duck Carpaccio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Croatian King Truffle Bar is an ice cream delicacy you can find in any street market freezer. It's multiple shells of chocolate and ice cream in an ice cream bar that speaks taste bud breaking volumes to at least the American palate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Philippines, they combine shaved ice, evaporated milk, purple yam ice cream, and tropical fruits into something they call &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo-halo"&gt;Halo-Halo&lt;/a&gt;. It's indescribably yummy and the Los Angeles-based Jollibee version Anthony Bourdain tried on his show is a pale comparison to the fantastic treat I've been lucky enough to devour in Manila.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-new-programming-technique-did-you-learn-this-year"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What New Programming Technique Did You Learn This Year?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard to say, but I'll go with Python's context managers. Trying to find a way to have what I learned see the light of day. Love the clients, but this is a good reason to try and do more open source work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="which-open-source-project-did-you-contribute-to-the-most-this-year-what-did-you-do"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Which Open Source Project Did You Contribute to the Most This Year? What Did You Do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I contributed nothing directly to the framework itself, between our book and numerous open source projects, I guess the answer is 'Django'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014 I want to switch that focus to Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-are-the-top-three-things-you-want-to-learn-next-year"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Are the Top Three Things You Want to Learn Next Year?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new async framework added in Python 3.4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C because I think it will enhance my Python skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to be a better person. I think I educated and helped a lot of people this year, but I can do better. &lt;strong&gt;Malcolm Tredennick&lt;/strong&gt; quietly led the way, and with all the help he provided to Audrey and I in January for our book, we owe it to his memory to improve the lot of developers everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-is-the-top-thing-you-wish-someone-would-write-next-year"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is the Top Thing You Wish Someone Would Write Next Year?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that gets more women into the top 10 of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.gittip.com/"&gt;Gittip&lt;/a&gt;. That amazing women developers and community leaders in the Python community like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.gittip.com/roguelynn/"&gt;Lynn Root&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.gittip.com/jessicamckellar/"&gt;Jessica McKellar&lt;/a&gt;, dare I say &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.gittip.com/audreyr/"&gt;Audrey&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.gittip.com/audreyr/"&gt;Roy&lt;/a&gt;, and others aren't up there speaks uncomfortable volumes. Starting today, I'm directing all my Gittip funds in their direction. Well... not Audrey because she won't let me, but you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-else"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Else?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, 2013, was a wonderful year. Everything changed. I hope to have a summary out today because some fantastically incredible things occurred. If not, then it will happen next year... err... tomorrow! ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

I've matched his meme the times he previousstarted it, and as you can tell from the title of this blog post I'm matching him yet again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="whats-the-coolest-python-application-framework-or-library-you-have-discovered-in-2012"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. What’s the coolest Python application, framework or library you have discovered in 2012?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question took some thought. It was a toss-up between these three choices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Django Class Based Views (CBVs) allow developers do amazing things with Django, but needed some polish (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/class-based-views/"&gt;improved documentation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://django-braces.readthedocs.org/"&gt;missing functionality&lt;/a&gt;) to be able to shine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://reportlab.org"&gt;ReportLab&lt;/a&gt; for generating PDF allowed me to create some &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.petcheatsheets.com/"&gt;impressive results&lt;/a&gt;, but the API needed updating. The other Python PDF libraries might be better, but getting images to work trivially in them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I didn't completely agree with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2012/12/29/sql-is-agile/"&gt;Armin Ronacher on the subject&lt;/a&gt;, I might have gone with a combination of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://api.mongodb.org/python/"&gt;PyMongo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mongoengine.org/"&gt;MongoEngine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://namlook.github.com/mongokit/"&gt;MongoKit&lt;/a&gt;. Just like Armin, I've learned through working with schemaless databases to know that schemas are awesome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winner?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Django Class Based Views&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012 what I managed to accomplish with Django CBVs was incredible. From early self-instructional work I did for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pydanny/django-mongonaut/blob/master/mongonaut/views.py"&gt;django-mongonaut&lt;/a&gt;, to client efforts and personal projects where I honed my craft, plus examples &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pydanny.com/tag/class-based-views.html"&gt;I blogged about&lt;/a&gt; or helped get into Django core, it made for a great year. Also I wasn't just productive personally, I helped increased the productivity of others around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you ain't seen nothing yet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-new-programming-technique-did-you-learn-in-2012"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. What new programming technique did you learn in 2012?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I understood multiple inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, since the start of this year I've delved really deep into it, only to discover just how much I didn't know. While that didn't do my ego any favors, it was a nice refreshing reminder not to get arrogant about one's skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="which-open-source-project-did-you-contribute-to-the-most-in-2012-what-did-you-do"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Which open source project did you contribute to the most in 2012? What did you do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to this is &lt;strong&gt;Django&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After using Django professionally for 2.5 years, I finally began contributing to the core framework at the DjangoCon Eu 2012 sprints. I joined a group of other dedicated people who decided to improve the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/topics/class-based-views/"&gt;Django CBV documentation&lt;/a&gt;, our goal being setting a new standard for documentation. I'm not sure if we set a new bar in documentation, but we did improve on the existing material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I branched out into some other areas of core Django development with mixed results, which played out that way because I just didn't have the time to do more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="which-python-blog-or-website-did-you-read-the-most-in-2012"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Which Python blog or website did you read the most in 2012?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://planet.python.org"&gt;http://planet.python.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-are-the-three-top-things-you-want-to-learn-in-2013"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. What are the three top things you want to learn in 2013?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Really advanced Python as taught by Raymond Hettiger or David Beazley.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really want to learn &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://twistedmatrix.com/"&gt;Twisted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to do an &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C3%BA#A.C3.BA"&gt;Aú sem Mão&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-is-the-top-software-application-or-library-you-wish-someone-would-write-in-2013"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. What is the top software, application or library you wish someone would write in 2013?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've got a couple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Python SDK that produces results that work perfectly for both modern iOS and Android. Think Corona SDK but with Python.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A modern PyGame release that installs trivially on Mac OS X.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="want-to-do-your-own-list-here-s-how"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Want to do your own list? here's how:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;copy-paste the questions and answer to them in your blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tweet it with the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%232012pythonmeme&amp;amp;src=typd"&gt;#2012pythonmeme&lt;/a&gt; hashtag&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Here is my meme submission:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="python-obfuscation-contest"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Python Obfuscation Contest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;certain-to-be-controversial talk idea&lt;/strong&gt; would be where the speaker would solicit Pythonistas to submit a single arcane &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://python.org"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; code module that would have to display the text of &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; There would be a '&lt;em&gt;Expert&lt;/em&gt;' category which would forbid the eval/exec functions. The &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Anything Goes Category&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; would allow use of &lt;strong&gt;eval/exec&lt;/strong&gt;. The conference talk would be where the speaker announces the winners and comments on the brilliant insanity of submissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="python-in-space"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Python in Space!!!!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to hear any talk on how Python is used in space exploration or research. That includes NASA, SpaceX, ESA staffers or citizen scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="template-language-shootout"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Template Language Shootout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want a benchmark heavy talk on the raw speed of various Python template systems, complete with hard numbers and pretty charts. This isn't just a matter of speed, but also a measure of terseness and total usage. The test code will need to be made public so it can be vetted, debated, and expanded upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="python-3-from-scratch"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Python 3 from scratch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to see a talk that shows how by using Python 3 from the start, you content that you got a edge over Python 2.x. This case study should be as technical as possible and shouldn't have anything do with migrating from 2.x to 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="fun-and-games-with-numpy"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Fun and games with NumPy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://numpy.scipy.org/"&gt;NumPy&lt;/a&gt; is an incredible library. It deserves a talk, specifically one where it is demonstrated to do something amazing. Maybe it's something scientific, maybe it's something crunching social data, maybe it's something I can't begin to imagine. Surprise and impress me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you go, my submission of 5 talks to the &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013"&gt;PyCon 2013&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;talks/tutorials I'd like to see&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; meme. What do you want to see?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now it's time for...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-public-service-message-to-the-python-community"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Public Service Message to the Python Community&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi, I'm Daniel Greenfeld. You might know me from my &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pydanny.com"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. I'm here to talk to you about a very import subject: &lt;strong&gt;Submit your talk early to PyCon US.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year there were hundreds of talks submitted for just a very few speaking slots. Unpaid volunteers labored for hours before and after their normal jobs reviewing and debating which talks were to get in. The volume of talks combined with simple reviewer fatigue means that earlier submitted talks get more attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't leave your poor talk or tutorial out in the cold. Help us fix the problem in one of two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/speaking/cfp"&gt;Submit your talk as early as possible&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pycon.blogspot.com/2012/07/i-want-you-for-pycon-program-commitee.html"&gt;Help review PyCon US talks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
