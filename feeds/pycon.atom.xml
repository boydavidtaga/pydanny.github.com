Even though the URL is old, the content is new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New to Python and/or conferences and attending the upcoming &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2015/"&gt;PyCon 2015&lt;/a&gt; in Montreal, Canada?  Or is this your first conference? Or perhaps your first conference longer than a weekend?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping to get the most out of joining thousands of Python enthusiasts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No worries! This guide will aid you in attending one of the best technical conferences on the planet. Even though I'm not attending on account of various reasons including finances, work, and personal projects, I'm going to share how to get through duration of pycon in good shape. I'm also going to share some great tricks to optimize the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="basics"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Basics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take at least one shower per day. Please.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring something to take notes. A paper notebook, laptop, or tablet. Anything!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are looking for work, bring business cards. Seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At every meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner) make a point of sitting with or going out with different people. Introduce yourself. Make new friends and learn new things!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can't make it to a talk, don't stress out. They are recorded and will be available later on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pyvideo.org"&gt;http://www.pyvideo.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act Professionally (see next section)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="be-professional"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Be Professional&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyCon is a professional event. Sure, lots of people are in t-shirts and are having fun, often in oddly goofy ways. Yet stepping outside the boundaries of civilized behavior is not acceptable. Keep in mind that PyCon US has a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2015/about/code-of-conduct/"&gt;code of conduct&lt;/a&gt;. Whether or not you agree with codes of conduct for conferences, PyCon US has one and it will be enforced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="get-to-the-registration-desk-early"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get to the Registration Desk Early&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the lines for registration can get epic, I like to get my badge as early as possible so I don't miss PyCon's famously incredible keynote speeches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="must-see-tutorials"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Must-See Tutorials&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the beginner tutorials at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/tutorials/"&gt;https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/tutorials/&lt;/a&gt; look wonderful. You simply can't go wrong with any of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="must-see-talks"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Must-See Talks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm actually a little relieved that I'm not going to PyCon, because there were some time slots thad several must-see talks running concurrently. I would have to clone myself repeatedly in order to see all the good stuff! Fortunately, I'll be able to watch them on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pyvideo.org"&gt;http://www.pyvideo.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are new to open source and plan to attend the PyCon 2015 sprints (or in general contribute to open source), then I strongly recommend Shauna Gordon-McKeon's &amp;quot;Open Source for Newcomers and the People Who Want to Welcome Them&amp;quot; talk (description at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/346/"&gt;https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/presentation/346/&lt;/a&gt;). She's the program director of Open Hatch, a group focused on bringing more people into the open source community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro-tip&lt;/strong&gt;: For the talks you are excited about attending, get there early. If you really  want to attend a particular talk, odds are so does everyone else and the room might be packed. Don't be forced to sit on the floor or stand outside the door. Show up early!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/talks/"&gt;https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/talks/&lt;/a&gt; for the talk schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="talk-attendance-guidelines"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Talk Attendance Guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At PyCon, talks are either 30 or 45 long. They represent the best and brightest in both old hands in the community and rising stars. Some quick guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask Questions!&lt;/strong&gt; If the speaker leaves time for questions at the end, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://cecinestpasun.com/entries/i-can-haz-question-or-five/"&gt;go and ask&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shut the Laptop and Turn Off the Device.&lt;/strong&gt; It's disconcerting to give a speech to hundreds of people staring at their portable electronics and not responding to your banter. Unless you are using electronics to actively take notes on the talk, consider turning them off to look at the speaker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't Heckle.&lt;/strong&gt; It's nerve wracking going up in front of hundreds of people live and tens of thousands on streaming video. Heckling is &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; funny and it's a good way to lose friends and make enemies. Unless the speaker asks for commentary during the talk, wait until the end and then ask your questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="lunches"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lunches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't forget to keep whatever they hand out to track meals at the registration desk or you might not be able to get your food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try and sit down to people you don't know and introduce yourself. Every time I do this I don't just get to meet interesting people, I get to meet amazing people. PyCon is full of brilliant minds and you'll never get to know any of them unless you try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="sprints"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sprints&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the tutorials and talks are over, the sprints begin. These are like hackathons, but for only open source efforts. Imagine the chance to apply everything you just learn, while sitting amongst other Python enthusiast including dozens of projects leaders. Not only do you get the chance to apply what you've just learned, you can contribute to make the world of Python better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2015/community/sprints/"&gt;https://us.pycon.org/2015/community/sprints/&lt;/a&gt; for general sprint information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="sprint-requirements"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sprint Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For beginners setting up a Python development environment can be tricky. If the list below looks intimidating, look for any sprints with &amp;quot;beginner&amp;quot; in the title. There is always something! While they aren't listed yet, but there should be something up within a week or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you want a pre-PyCon challenge, I recommend getting the the following installed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Modern versions of Python:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python 2.7 (mandatory)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python 3.4 (Rather mandatory for Python 3 work)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Be ready with source control. You should have installed and possess working knowledge with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Git. Really make sure you have a GitHub account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mercurial. Useful to have a BitBucket account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/index.html"&gt;virtualenv&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html"&gt;pip&lt;/a&gt; for all versions of Python. If you are using Python 3.4, you don't need to have them installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;An IDE or Text Editor you are comfortable using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="staying-healthy-over-nine-days-of-python"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Staying Healthy Over Nine Days of Python!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you attend the tutorials, talks and sprints, that's &lt;strong&gt;nine days&lt;/strong&gt;. You (or your organization) are putting out some serious money for you to go and discover new knowledge, new people, or a bunch of other reasons. The last thing you want to do is end up sick for part or all of the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odds are you'll be riding in public transit (planes, trains, buses) to get there. Unfortunately, you'll be travelling with people who are sick. Then, for over a week, you'll be around thousands of people who have travelled under similar conditions. Many of those people, possibly yourself, will be eating poorly, drinking heavily, and not getting enough sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some things I've found work wonders to keep me active and alert and I recommend you do the same &lt;strong&gt;every&lt;/strong&gt; day of the conference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take at least one shower per day. Please.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat at least two good meals. Make a point of sitting with different people at each meal and introducing yourself. Make new friends!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get at least three hours of sleep. More if possible because your brain is going to go into learning overdrive.  I aim for 6-8 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Airborne-Support-Supplement-Vitamin-Effervescent/dp/B000WZI4WY?tag=mlinar-20"&gt;Immune System Boosters&lt;/a&gt; and consume them daily. I usually do it with breakfast and lunch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="get-autographs"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get Autographs!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an author, I can't recommend enough that you bring your favorite programming book and get it autographed. A few books I want to get signed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449340377/?tag=cn-001-20"&gt;Python Cookbook, by David Beazley and Brian Jones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

If you want to know what that is, you can read the &lt;cite&gt;Not Safe For Work (NSFW) Wikipedia article&lt;/cite&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a hernia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's one thing to admit you are sick or have an injury, but it's another thing to admit you have a lower abdominal injury caused by lifting too much. Even if 27% of men get it in their lifetime, it's still hard to admit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-did-i-get-a-hernia"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Did I Get A Hernia?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic predisposition, not to mention moving a refrigerator. And a sofa. And much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year in early April my wife and were given the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pydanny.com/off-to-europe.html"&gt;chance to work in Europe&lt;/a&gt; for a while. We moved out of our place and put all our stuff into storage. We don't have that much stuff, so we decided to do all the packing and moving ourselves. While I hadn't worked out consistently in a couple of months, I &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; I was up for any heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, for all my adult life every once in a while I either moved or helped friends move their stuff. I'm in pretty good shape, have endurance, and know how to lift. I'm really flexible too, able to get low and push up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several days Audrey and I packed and moved stuff into the storage facility. It was hard, sweaty work and we were racing to meet a deadline. I didn't mind the work or pace at all. For me it's fun to do hard labor for short periods and this was a blast. I also love pushing myself physically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's review:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had to move lots of stuff in a few days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stuff was not gym-style weights, but awkward boxes and furniture. Some of it heavy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love to push myself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got it done just in time! Hooray! I was achey and sore, but really proud of what we did. Something didn't feel quite right &lt;em&gt;down there&lt;/em&gt;. I shrugged it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="something-is-wrong"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Something is Wrong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way to Europe I realized something was wrong. I thought it would go away, especially with good food and exercise. During the journey and once we arrived, I tried working out, but afterwards I would be in more discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter. We worked long, hard hours and spent the weekends sightseeing. It was awesome. We met lots of our online friends. We attended amazing conferences and events. It was incredible, and I pray I get to do it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except that all that walking and standing ached. Over a few hours that ache would turn to pain. I thought it would go away, but it didn't. Over time it hurt more and more. Often, out with friends, I pleaded exhaustion. We kept going home early. Actually, I was just in a lot of pain that I didn't understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My pride meant I didn't want to admit I was hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="admitting-the-problem-and-diagnosis"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Admitting the Problem and Diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one of our last days in Zagreb, Croatia we took a very long walk. Far from our lodging the discomfort got so bad that I sat on the ground. Getting home was a nightmare. That was when we realized something was really wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to keep walking to a minimum after that. We readied for our next stop, the beachside city of Split in Croatia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived in Split we did a little research and discovered that I probably had a hernia. We went to a physician, and he confirmed it. He had me see a surgeon, who confirmed it as well. While he suggested surgery, he also let us know that just then wasn't a good time - there was a threat of a nurses' strike in Croatia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to wait until we got back to the USA and the Affordable Care Act went into effect. I could wait that long if I was careful abut exercise and wore a brace. It sucked, because I would have to wait or pay completely out of pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waiting was necessary because I didn't want to spend all my earnings for a time feeding the heartless American insurance bureaucracy industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as it was available we signed up for proper American medical coverage through the Affordable Care Act. I now have medical coverage! I went through the necessary appointments and was recommended the surgery that's going to happen in two days. The operation should take 90 minutes and I'm going home the same day. Two weeks after surgery I'll be feeling completely normal, and a month after surgery I can carefully restart my exercise regimen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="living-with-a-hernia"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Living With a Hernia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's doable but I don't recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I walk or exercise, then I have to wear a brace. That brace gets uncomfortable the longer I wear it, but it's better than the alternative. It's risky for me to max out my weights unless I'm on a machine. I can't do any direct abdominal exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the brace I'm not supposed to lift anything heavier than 15 pounds. Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-part-i-really-don-t-like"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Part I Really Don't Like&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm scared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logically I know it's a low risk operation done millions of times a year around the world. That my surgeon is rated extremely well. Still, it's me going under general anesthesia so a really nice lady can cut holes in me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'm scared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try not to think about it, the same way I ignored the injury during most of my time in Europe. So far it's been working pretty well, except when I'm driving or trying to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pycon-in-montreal"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PyCon in Montreal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're not going. We weren't going because of finances, work, etc., but the scheduled surgery cemented it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="wish-me-luck"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wish Me Luck!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't wait for this to be done and finished. I want to be able to do things again. To walk and run for hours with no more discomfort than aching feet. To be able to pick things up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's going to be delightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more thing: next time I'm hiring movers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</summary><category term="blog"></category><category term="pycon"></category><category term="surgery"></category></entry><entry><title>Memories of Malcolm</title><link href="http://pydanny.com/memories-of-malcolm.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-03-17T12:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Daniel-Roy-Greenfeld</name></author><id>tag:pydanny.com,2014-03-17:memories-of-malcolm.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A year ago today &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://about.me/malcolmt"&gt;Malcolm Tredinnick&lt;/a&gt;, core contributor to Django suddenly passed away. He was a mentor, and more importantly, a good friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of my memories of Malcolm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="djangocon-us-september-2010"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DjangoCon US: September 2010&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where Audrey and I first met Malcolm. We ended up spending a good amount of the conference with him just hanging out and having a good time. I remember being honored that such a luminary wanted to spend time with us, yet was more delighted in discovering a good friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the conference, he peered into the nascent code base of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangopackages.com"&gt;djangopackages.com&lt;/a&gt; and asked some pointed questions. We justified a few design decisions, and he agreed, and we saw him using similar techniques later. He gave us some great pointers on things we could do, and I believe we implemented all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="summer-to-autumn-of-2010"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summer to Autumn of 2010&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malcolm and I worked together on a project in 2010. During this time we had a number of email and chat discussions. Going over them now I'm impressed by his friendship and generosity of knowledge. I know he was terribly busy but yet he always had time for me in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about 15 emails where I addressed him as 'Malcom', Malcolm finally got me to consistently spell his name correctly with a single sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be amazed at how cranky it makes me when people try to spell Malcolm with only one &amp;quot;l&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was Malcolm: Acerbic yet tempered with a smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pycon-australia-august-2011"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PyCon Australia: August 2011&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had just arrived in Sydney. Our first overseas trip together! Audrey was giving the opening keynote at PyCon Australia. She wanted to practice her speech but I was restless. So she suggested that I go out for dinner, specifically sushi train with Malcolm Tredinnick and Russell Keith-Magee. I don't remember anything about the food, but I do remember having a great time with good friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the conference one evening Audrey and I spent a few hours with just Malcolm walking around Sydney. None of us wanted it to end. The time spent together outside of the insane pace of a conference was a poignant reminder that even with email, chat, and IRC, there was still thousands of miles between us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pycon-philippines-june-2012"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PyCon Philippines: June 2012&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On his own dollar, Malcolm had dropped everything to attend. He spoke, he taught, and he made many friends. I have to admit being jealous of the students in the Django tutorial he taught because they got to spend time with him. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was our last time with Malcolm, and it was so brief, so limited. I was okay with that because I thought I would get a chance to see him again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="two-scoops-of-django-october-2012-january-2013"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Two Scoops of Django: October 2012-January 2013&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://twoscoopspress.com/pages/malcolm-tredinnick-memorial"&gt;memorial&lt;/a&gt; we wrote for Malcolm, you can see that his presence is an integral part of Two Scoops of Django. He coached us, guided us, forced us to dig deeper and deeper into source code. Of special note is the database chapter (excluding the 1.6 edition transactions), which he really focused on.&lt;/p&gt;

This particular safety-related post is about theft, not scams, which I may cover in another article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this first article, I'm hoping this gets on various technical RSS feeds. I'm doing this because many of the readers of such feeds attend conferences and are strangers in far and distant places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="about-thieves"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About Thieves&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thieves (or pick pockets) are everywhere. I've seen extremely suspicious activity in Portland, Los Angeles, Washington DC, Barcelona, Florence, Pisa, and Krakow. Years ago in Washington DC I had stuff stolen from me twice so I've been observant and careful ever since. Anywhere there are non-residents distracted by looking at new vistas while suffering from travel fatigue is where most thieves can be found. I've learned a lot by observation and doing research but I don't claim to be an expert. All I claim to be is someone who doesn't want to be ripped off far from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-basics-any-place-with-tourists-is-risky"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Basics: Any place with tourists is risky&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it can be said that thieves can be anywhere, the truth is that they focus on where the tourists go. We carry money and expensive things, are tired, distracted, and don't know our way around. For a thief, A moment of risk can yield hundreds or thousands of dollars of profit from a traveler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="i-ve-never-had-any-problems-there"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;quot;I've never had any problems there&amp;quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've heard this several times from local residents or travelers, often about places with statistically high crime rates. You'll hear it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that means is that they've either been lucky or unobservant. It's better to avoid a miserable trip by being a least a little careful with your identity, money, and electronics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="listen-to-warnings-before-you-go-places"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Listen to warnings before you go places&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Barcelona our host warned us about La Rambla, a tourist-heavy street that's notoriously thick with thieves. While we're always careful, we were especially observant there, and enjoyed the very lovely and friendly downtown Barcelona without incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, don't pay attention to warnings at locations. Public notices about thieves are a nasty trap. When you see them you check your most expensive things, giving away the location of money, jewelry, watches, and cell phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="watch-how-local-residents-protect-themselves"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Watch how local residents protect themselves&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In suspicious places you'll notice local men with their hands in their pockets. Why? It's because they are literally keeping their hands on the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same places, local women will take a shirt, sweater, or even a newspaper and have it on top of their purse with their arm on top of that. Where &amp;quot;man-purses&amp;quot; are acceptable wear, men will do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="good-thieves-look-like-tourists-or-non-criminals"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Good thieves Look like tourists or non-criminals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people or articles warn you about this or that ethnicity or how people dress. That's not just racist and shallow, it's stupid and inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thieves simply don't want to be noticed, and if noticed they want escape to be as easy as possible. Which means the more active and successful ones dress and act like everyone around you. Which means, for example, in Europe the better thieves are of Caucasian descent and dress like American visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do note that criminals from a non-majority ethnicity do exist, but they aren't likely to be thieves. This is because being an ethnic minority makes them easier to spot and track down. Also, the all-too-human justice system is harsher on them. Instead, they are often the ones preying on tourists by selling cheap, overpriced trinkets on the sidewalks to tourists who often don't realize they are breaking local laws by purchasing from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="underage-thieves-are-fearless"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Underage thieves are fearless&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underage thieves have the benefit of that they don't have to worry about the justice system. In many places the police can't arrest children under a certain age and have to let them go. Also, if they are caught, if they are in a gang, an older family member&amp;quot; will come up, rebuke them publicly, and most people will let it go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="an-ounce-of-preperation"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An ounce of preperation...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a good idea to spend a little time and money getting a few things before you travel. Why? Cause here are the easiest targets in rough order of ease for thieves (1 is super-easy, 7 is merely easy):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backbacks without locks worn on the back. &lt;strong&gt;Warning&lt;/strong&gt;: Don't put passports in your backback!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fanny pack or wallet in the back pocket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grocery or store-purchase bag&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any outside-pocket cellphone holder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suitcases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wallet in the front pocket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="don-t-be-stupid"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Don't be stupid&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least one travel writer advocates putting your stuff in a local grocery or store bag. That way you &amp;quot;fit in&amp;quot;, thieves ignore you, and you can confidently enjoy your visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;mind-bogglingly stupid&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confidence means you allow yourself to be distracted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unless you live somewhere, you stand out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grocery or store bags are not designed to carry things for hours on end. They break.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grocery or store bags are one of the easiest target for thieves. They either don't close adequately or are the perfect target for razor armed thieves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="your-wallet"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Your wallet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your ID out and only keep a very small amount of money in your wallet, which should be in your front pocket. Take the credit cards out and put them in secret stashes. If you really want a credit card in your wallet, get one linked to a bank account with just enough money for the day in it. Add more money to it as you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="shorten-the-straps"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Shorten the Straps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep the straps of your stuff short and in your hands. When walking next to a street, keep bags on the far side from the road. Moped thieves will will snatch and pull you until the straps break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="use-secret-stashes-on-your-person"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use secret stashes on your person&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most sporting good stores sell money belts and underclothes pouches. Use the money belt to store cash. Use an underclothes pouch to store your passport and at least one credit card. For underclothes pouches I recommend you open packages and feel the material against your skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="consider-buying-anti-theft-backpacks-laptop-bags"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Consider buying anti-theft backpacks / laptop bags&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We prefer &lt;strong&gt;PacSafe&lt;/strong&gt; brand gear because the clasps are hidden and require a trick to open. Their stuff also has steel wire woven into their straps and fabric, meaning they can't get cut by a razor. PacSafe stuff isn't cheap but the peace of mind has been definitely worth the price. We've relied on the PacSafe &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Pacsafe-Metrosafe-Anti-Theft-Tablet-Laptop/dp/B00AVXDELI/?tag=ihpydanny-20"&gt;laptop bag&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Pacsafe-Luggage-Slingsafe-Shoulder-Black/dp/B006QLMDH0/?tag=ihpydanny-20"&gt;shoulder bag&lt;/a&gt; for about 18 months now and they've been awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.amazon.com/Pacsafe-Metrosafe-Anti-Theft-Tablet-Laptop/dp/B00AVXDELI/?tag=ihpydanny-20"&gt;&lt;img alt="My laptop bag" class="align-center" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41lh%2B2goeNL._SL500_SS80_.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My laptop bag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.amazon.com/Pacsafe-Luggage-Slingsafe-Shoulder-Black/dp/B006QLMDH0/?tag=ihpydanny-20"&gt;&lt;img alt="Audrey's shoulder bag" class="align-center" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31jF8RBoBEL._SL500_SS80_.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Audrey's shoulder bag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="identifying-thief-tactics"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Identifying Thief Tactics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a successful thief requires the same skills as a magician. Observation, distraction, misdirection, staged audience members, and timing are how they do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some common techniques they use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-big-local-attraction"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Big Local Attraction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you are gazing at the masterpiece of architecture, hungrily peering at the door menu, or the incredible street performance, your focus is off your stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: Train yourself so when you start to feel distracted to put your arm or hand on your most expensive stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-magician"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Magician&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reference, this is literally the same sort of sleight-of-hand that magicians use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pickpockets often have a newspaper, expensive jacket, or nice sweater in one hand to block what they are doing. While they engage you in friendly conversation they use the prop to block your like of sight from their other hand, which is busy. Especially good thieves don't even bother with the props and just rely on the width of their arm to block lines of observation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: If someone you don't know shows something up close to you, back off. In fact, just apologize and keep your distance. It's perfectly okay to not follow &amp;quot;local custom&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-spill"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Spill&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone throws anything at you, or if something is spilled on you, the thief helps you clean up, their accomplice is going through your stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: Back up and start screaming &amp;quot;Help, Thief&amp;quot; because it means you've been targeted and are under active scam. Cover your stuff with your arms and hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-fall"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Fall&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is hard to deal with, especially for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a person falls or stumbles around you, don't help them, regardless of their age or apparent infirmity. While you help them their accomplice is taking from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: Unless there is obvious injury, back off and let the locals take care of it, or find the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-gift"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Gift&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year the new trick is for someone to ask you if you want them to take pictures of you using your camera or cell phone. You hand them your camera and they start running. &lt;em&gt;You've literally 'gifted' them your camera!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: Look for someone to take your picture, never the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="your-room"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Your Room&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While staying at a hotel/hostel/BnB you go out for the day in a place without a safe. When you come back your valuables are gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: No safe? Carry your valuables!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="if-you-catch-a-thief"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;If you catch a thief&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've caught them in the act. Maybe you've grabbed them or maybe they started running. Follow these steps to avoid injury and even death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="don-t-chase-thieves"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;DON'T CHASE THIEVES&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever you do, don't chase thieves. Thieves of all ages are usually in gangs or have friends nearby. Their 'backup' carry weapons ranging from sticks to knives to guns. People die from chasing thieves every year in every country. Nothing you are carrying is worth your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="call-for-help"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Call for help&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how to yell &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Help, Thief!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; in the local language. Often the locals may deal with it as they hate thieves since crime damages their businesses and local reputation. In fact sometimes the response is overwhelmingly violent. There are stories of would-be victims in Africa, India, and Europe intervening to save the life of a would-be thief's life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-police"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Police&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's pretty universal police who deal with street crime wear uniforms. Work with them and if they ask you if you want to press charges, do so. Otherwise in many places they have to let the person go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="danger-the-undercover-police"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;DANGER: The 'undercover' police&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone not wearing a uniform and claiming to be 'undercover' is an accomplice, scam artist, or worse. If they 'come to help':&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't give up any identification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demand that uniformed police be summoned by radio or phone to this location immediately. If the 'undercover' police refuse, then they are a scam or worse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't leave the spot!&lt;/strong&gt; If 'undercover' police try to get you to come with them, refuse loudly. If they try to force you away, start yelling as if your life is in danger, &lt;strong&gt;because it is&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="in-closing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In Closing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theft is real. Go to Youtube and spent 10 minutes searching on &amp;quot;thief&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;pickpocket&amp;quot; for proof. Most of the videos are surveillance videos, but when magicians talk about theft it's pretty fun to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, it's easy to dramatically decrease your chances of being a victim of this kind of crime by being prepared and vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/122/"&gt;Teaching with the IPython Notebook&lt;/a&gt; (Matt Davis) - The IPython Notebook is an unbelievably incredible tool. Imagine a Python shell that allows you to embed images and graphs right into the REPL. Designed by and for scientists, the IPython Notebook is useful for developers of all levels. You have to see it in action to believe it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="id4"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2:35 PM talks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a rough spot because there are four really beginner good talks by four great speakers happening at the same time. Since all of this are going to be wonderful presentations, I'm labeling them all as 'must-see'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/141/"&gt;Who are we? A sociological analysis of the indigenous Python tribe&lt;/a&gt; (Jackie Kazil) - Journalist and computer scientist at the Library of Congress, Jackie Kazil uses her amazing skills to analyze the Python community's code bases across thousands of projects to determine where we've been as a people and we are going in the future. If you want to see how an expert analyzes trends in the Python-verse, this is a talk that can't be missed!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/67/"&gt;Building full-stack scientific applications in Python&lt;/a&gt; (Luke Lee) - Did you know that Python is used in high performance scientific applications? Tools like SciPy and NumPy are built on top of very robust, optimized C and Fortran libraries. Luke will cover their use and also how to present the data using tools like PyQt. If you are into big data, you can't miss this talk!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/146/"&gt;Customizing the Django Admin: The How and the Why&lt;/a&gt; (Lakshman Prasad) - Following my talk is a deep dive into Django's famous admin interface. I was fortunate enough to get a sneak preview of the talk and I can say with confidence this is going to be an incredible presentation. Don't miss it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/92/"&gt;Location, Location, Location&lt;/a&gt; (Julia Grace) - Django, via the GeoDjango toolkit has amazing support for building GIS based applications. Julia's an experienced developer and great speaker, making this a can't miss talk!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="id5"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3:15 PM talks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn't a beginner-focused talk in this slot, so I'm going to make this the &lt;em&gt;roller-coaster&lt;/em&gt; slot. In other words, I'm going to steer you to the most intensely advanced talk at this time. Attend, buckle in the safety harness, and drink in the extreme knowledge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/80/"&gt;Making Apache suck less for hosting Python web applications&lt;/a&gt; (Graham Dumpleton) - It is not hard to find developers who will tell you that Apache sucks for running Python web applications. Is there a valid basis to such claims or have they simply been misguided by the views of others? Well, Graham understands how Python serves up web pages and won't hold back on technical detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/130/"&gt;Numba: A Dynamic Python compiler for Science&lt;/a&gt; (Travis Oliphant, Siu Kwan Lam, Mark Florisson) - Numba is a compiler for Python syntax that uses the LLVM library and llvmpy to convert specifically decorated Python functions to machine code at run-time. It allows Python syntax to be used to do scientific and numerical computing that is blazing fast yet tightly integrated with the CPython run-time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="talk"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4:15 talk&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this time period there is a single talk specifically aimed at beginners. There are some other useful talks around this time, but they are aimed at educators and integrators over beginners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/74/"&gt;Crypto 101&lt;/a&gt; (Laurens Van Houtven) - Cryptography is a tricky subject, and the goal of this 4:15 PM talk isn't to turn attendees into cryptography experts. Instead, you'll have a basic understanding of how some common systems compare, and also a sense for detecting and exposing snake oil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pm-talk"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4:30 PM talk&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/102/"&gt;Getting Python and Django Through Your Java Shop Front Door (with Jython)&lt;/a&gt; (Frank Wierzbicki) - Work in a Java shop and want to bring in Python? Learn how to do it using Jython, the Python implementation that works in the JVM!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="id6"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5:10 PM talks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/138/"&gt;MTO On Blast: Using Python's Natural Language Toolkit to Model Gossip Blogs&lt;/a&gt; (Robert Elwell) - Python's powerful Natural Language Toolkit will be featured as the presenter gives an overview of Natural Language Processing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/103/"&gt;What is the Python Software Foundation?&lt;/a&gt; (Brian Curtin) - This talk aims to engage us in thinking about what it takes to further Python. Whether it's an idea of code, community, or otherwise, it will jumpstart us into helping the very positive community that has brought us together for the amazing event that is PyCon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/128/"&gt;Asset Management in Python&lt;/a&gt; (Robert Kluin, Beau Lyddon) - Coffeescript, Less, SASS, and all those other exciting new front end asset tools can be a challenge to deploy when doing web development in tools like Django, Flask, and Pyramid. The presenters will introduce &lt;em&gt;webassets&lt;/em&gt;, a library designed to make deployment of assets quick and easy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="evening-activities"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Evening Activities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday night will be the evening of a huge number of fantastic fun. Two items of note (more to come):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/sponsors/charityauction/"&gt;The PyCon Charity Auction&lt;/a&gt; (6:30 PM+) - Along with Disney Animation Studios and many others, Audrey and I are contributing! In fact, we're submitting a one of a kind, preview copy of the upcoming print edition of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://django.2scoops.org"&gt;Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.5&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The famously unrecorded Testing in Python Birds of a Feathers event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="part-iv"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Part IV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for Part IV of this series where I cover the third day of talks best suited for new Python developers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;You just finished the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/intro/tutorial01/"&gt;Django tutorial&lt;/a&gt;. What now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You learn how to Wire Up Django Packages!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a 3+ hour &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/11/"&gt;PyCon tutorial&lt;/a&gt; on March 14th at 1:20pm, in Santa Clara California at &lt;a class="reference internal" href="#pycon"&gt;PyCon&lt;/a&gt; US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In alphabetical order, the instructors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://audreymroy.com/"&gt;Audrey Roy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daniel Greenfeld (myself)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://gettingstartedwithdjango.com/"&gt;Kenneth Love&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tutorial-description"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tutorial Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Django is part of an ecosphere of over 20,000 packages, which can be leveraged to great effect. This tutorial will teach the evaluation, use, and extension of third party Python and Django applications in your projects. This tutorial will be a lecture with a lot of detailed and annotated code examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pycon"&gt;This tutorial does much more than instruct on how to wire in third party packages, it also instructs on Django/Python best practices such as PEP-8, loose coupling, good database design, clarity of concept, and workable patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Material covered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluating packages using Django Packages, PyPI, Read the Docs, and other sources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must-include packages for every project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Class-based Views&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Templates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Admin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="format"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Format&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be a lecture with detailed and annotated code examples. Attendees will have a chance per section to ask questions and submit alternative packages of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="prerequisites"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical or professional experience with Django is recommended, but the material covered will be useful to anyone familiar with Python who has completed the Django tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a new Python developer, we suggest in addition to our course you sign up for some of the introductory Python tutorials taught at PyCon next week. If that is not possible or you wish reinforcement, please dive into one of the following resources before you attend:&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><category term="python"></category><category term="django"></category><category term="pycon"></category></entry><entry><title>Two Scoops of Django 1.5 Beta Released</title><link href="http://pydanny.com/two-scoops-beta-released.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-02-28T15:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Daniel-Roy-Greenfeld</name></author><id>tag:pydanny.com,2013-02-28:two-scoops-beta-released.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After thirty four days of hard work, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://audreymroy.com"&gt;Audrey Roy&lt;/a&gt; and I are proud to announce that we've released the &lt;strong&gt;beta&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://django.2scoops.org"&gt;Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.5&lt;/a&gt;. It's been a monumental effort, a labor of love, and we hope you find our efforts worthy. You can buy it right now in e-book (PDF) form on the website: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://django.2scoops.org"&gt;http://django.2scoops.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.5 is a compilation of best practices for the Django framework. Like any framework, Django has tips, tricks, and pitfalls that aren't documented in one place. Experienced developers know this stuff, but gleaning it off the Internet takes a lot of time. We decided to take everything we know and write it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stand of the shoulders of giants: We received advice from Django experts including a BDFL, Django core developers, and subject matter experts from around the world. Reader contributions from advanced and beginning developers have also shaped the book, and we can't thank enough those who gave us their insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://django.2scoops.org/"&gt;&lt;img alt="https://s3.amazonaws.com/twoscoops/img/tsd-cover-beta.png" class="align-center" id="two-scoops-of-django" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/twoscoops/img/tsd-cover-beta.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a name="features"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="section" id="what-is-different-about-the-beta-release"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is different about the beta release?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added 50+ pages of content while reducing the file size from 5.1 MB to 1.5 MB.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added list of tables, list of figures, and an index.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dramatically improved the chapters on security, testing, logging, admin, and many more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added so many more code samples that even with the new example numbering system we lost count.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of code examples, most of the code samples in the book are loaded directly out of fully tested projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorporated the feedback of dozens of readers. Thank you so much for your contributions!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a name="what-do-i-get"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-does-buying-the-beta-get-me"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does buying the beta get me?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access the PDF version of the book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to the Kindle and ePub formats when we release the final.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to final release of the book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a name="alternative-formats"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="why-aren-t-there-kindle-or-epub-versions-yet"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why aren't there Kindle or ePub versions yet?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to support more formats, but won't do it poorly. It's going to take us at least several days to render the book in an alternative format that looks good. Since we both have multiple presentations at the upcoming &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/"&gt;PyCon US&lt;/a&gt;, we simply don't have time to get it done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a name="alpha-buyers"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="if-i-bought-the-alpha-do-i-have-to-buy-the-beta"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;If I bought the alpha do I have to buy the beta?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpha buyers get full access the beta. In fact, you should have already received an email with a link to the latest version. If that hasn't arrived, please email us at &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:2scoops&amp;#64;cartwheelweb.com"&gt;2scoops&amp;#64;cartwheelweb.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a name="beginners"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="is-this-book-good-for-beginners"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is this book good for beginners?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response from beginning Django developers reading it has been &lt;strong&gt;unbelievably, overwhelmingly positive&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the book we wanted to have when we learned Django, and we're honored by the response the book has received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the book isn't a tutorial, we ask that before beginners purchase it, they &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/"&gt;learn the fundamentals of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Learn-Python-Hard-Way-Introduction/dp/0321884914/?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=ihpydanny-20"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; and take the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/intro/tutorial01/"&gt;official Django tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When beginners find sections of the book above their head, they do what everyone does when reading a technical reference: skip over challenging sections until they have enough grounding to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any beginners are confused by our explanations, or have difficulties, please email us at &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:2scoops&amp;#64;cartwheelweb.com"&gt;2scoops&amp;#64;cartwheelweb.com&lt;/a&gt;. We'll do our best to answer your questions. Your issues provide invaluable insight into what we need to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a name="experienced"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="is-this-book-good-for-experienced-developers"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is this book good for experienced developers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've done our best to provide worthwhile material for developers of all levels. In fact, a lot of intermediate to advanced developers have said they've found good things to use in our book. Many have also found that by using our book as a supplementary manual, it helps them their team work better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a name="updates"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="is-this-book-going-to-get-updated"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is this book going to get updated?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the &lt;strong&gt;alpha&lt;/strong&gt; we updated the book multiple times before knuckling down on the &lt;strong&gt;beta&lt;/strong&gt; rewrite. Even after the final version comes out, we'll continue to update the book. One of the advantages of self-published e-books is we have total control of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a name="print"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="when-can-i-get-a-print-version"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When can I get a print version?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a lot of consideration, we've decided to hold off on the print version of the book until what we call the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pydanny.com/two-scoops-beta-released.html#final"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt; release, which won't be released until after &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/"&gt;PyCon US&lt;/a&gt;. We're very finicky and don't want buyers of the print version to have an unfinished book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a name="tutorial"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a name="pycon"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a name="wiring-up-django-packages"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tutorial-pycon-are-you-going"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tutorial? PyCon? Are you going?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! We're going to be at PyCon next month!  We're giving the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/11/"&gt;Wiring Up Django Packages&lt;/a&gt; tutorial, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://brack3t.com/"&gt;Kenneth Love&lt;/a&gt; (of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://gettingstartedwithdjango.com/"&gt;Getting Started with Django&lt;/a&gt; fame) is part of our team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While tickets to PyCon itself are sold out, you can still &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/registration/register/"&gt;register for the tutorials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a name="final"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="when-is-the-book-s-final-release"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When is the book's final release?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final release won't occur until after PyCon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our plan for the final release of Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.5 is to focus on errata, alternative electronic formats, and the print version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a name="bulk"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="can-we-purchase-the-book-in-bulk"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can we purchase the book in bulk?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're working on a program to provide organizations the capability to purchase many e-copies and keep the recipients of the book updated constantly. We hope to have this ready in a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a name="paypal"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="can-i-buy-the-book-via-paypal"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can I buy the book via PayPal?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. I've answered in full &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pydanny.com/we-are-not-using-paypal.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're considering other non-credit card options to handle payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a name="known-issue-warnings"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="known-issue-warnings"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Known Issue Warnings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="copy-paste"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Copy/Paste&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are problems with copy/pasting of code from the PDF. The new build process is turning the code examples into some sort of image type of object, which explains the strange characters. We're working on it, but aren't sure how long the fix will take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Android&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Android, if you try to open the PDF directly from the Gumroad download, you might get a &amp;quot;Cannot open file&amp;quot; error; however, if you navigate to the download location on your phone/tablet with a file browser (e.g. Samsung's &amp;quot;My Files&amp;quot;), you should be able to open the file from there. Gumroad is currently investigating the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a name="errata"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="where-should-i-send-errata-or-suggestions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where should I send errata or suggestions?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please send errata to &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:2scoops&amp;#64;cartwheelweb.com"&gt;2scoops&amp;#64;cartwheelweb.com&lt;/a&gt;. We try to respond personally to every request.&lt;/p&gt;

The goal is to provide a handy reference guide for first time attendees of the world's largest &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://python.org"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; conference. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pydanny.com/beginners-guide-pycon-2013-part-1.html"&gt;Part I&lt;/a&gt; was mostly about &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/tutorials/"&gt;tutorials&lt;/a&gt;, this post will be about registration and the first day of talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="registration"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Registration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven't done so yet, please &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/registration/register/"&gt;register&lt;/a&gt; now. Last year PyCon sold out way in advance, and hundreds missed the event. Which is a shame, because the conference is awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that the money you spend on registration will go towards a very good thing. You see, after the costs for running PyCon are subtracted, the rest will go to the non-profit Python Software Foundation (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://python.org/psf/"&gt;PSF&lt;/a&gt;). In addition to supporting the Python language itself, the PSF provides financial aid and grants for aspiring developers around the world. Which means the money you spend registering for PyCon will literally change people's lives. This isn't an idle exaggeration, this outreach has made a difference for you, me, and arguably the world. I would love to say more, but that's an article for another day...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, on to the talks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="talk-attendance-guidelines"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Talk Attendance Guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At PyCon, talks are either 30 or 45 long. They represent the best and brightest in both old hands in the community and rising stars. Some quick guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask Questions!&lt;/strong&gt; If the speaker leaves time for questions at the end, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://cecinestpasun.com/entries/i-can-haz-question-or-five/"&gt;go and ask&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shut the Laptop and Turn Off the Device.&lt;/strong&gt; It's disconcerting to give a speech to hundreds of people staring at their portable electronics and not responding to your banter. Unless you are using electronics to actively take notes on the talk, consider turning them off to look at the speaker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't Heckle.&lt;/strong&gt; It's nerve wracking going up in front of hundreds of people live and tens of thousands on streaming video. Heckling is &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; funny and it's a good way to lose friends and make enemies. Unless the speaker asks for commentary during the talk, wait until the end and then ask your questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, that out of the way, let's take a look at what Friday, March 15th, has to offer in terms of beginner friendly talks...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="friday-morning"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Friday Morning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The registration desk opens at 7:00 AM. Breakfast begins at 8:00 AM. From 9:00 AM to 10:20 AM is the welcome and initial keynote speeches. PyCon keynotes aren't boring - &lt;strong&gt;they are crazy awesome!&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In selecting these talks, I've tried to focus on the more technical ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="am-talks"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;10:50 AM talks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/35/"&gt;How to Except When You're Excepting&lt;/a&gt; (Esther Nam) - One of the rising stars of the community, Esther works for a group that demands 100% test coverage. She's going to cover the fundamentals of writing tests and why tests are a good thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/50/"&gt;How the Internet works&lt;/a&gt; (Jessica McKellar) - Want to know how the internet actually works? Jessica McKellar (also giving two tutorials and a keynote speech) will use Python to help you understand what's really going on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/116/"&gt;Gittip: Inspiring Generosity&lt;/a&gt; (Chad Whitacre) - Gittip is an open source Python platform for sustaining open source development via small, anonymous donations. This is a technical case-study about the story of community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="id1"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;11:30 AM talks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/135/"&gt;Scrapy: it GETs the web&lt;/a&gt; (Asheesh Laroia) - In 2009 I took a web scraping tutorial by the author. He impressed me with his energy and knowledge. While technically this is an &lt;strong&gt;intermediate&lt;/strong&gt; talk, I know everyone will get something out of this talk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="id2"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;12:10 AM talks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/39/"&gt;API Design for Library Authors&lt;/a&gt; (Chris McDonough) - Well designed APIs are critical for how other developers interact with your code. Chris is one of the talents in the community when it comes to creating easy-to-use but extremely powerful tools. I'm delighted he's made this an introductory talk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="friday-lunch"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Friday Lunch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't forget to keep your PyCon meal tickets you got when you registered in the morning or they won't let you into the lunch room!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sit down to people you don't know and introduce yourself. Every time I do this I don't just get to meet interesting people, I get to meet &lt;strong&gt;amazing&lt;/strong&gt; people. PyCon is full of brilliant minds and you'll never get to know any of them unless you try.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="friday-afternoon"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Friday Afternoon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got lunch? Time for more talks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pm-talks"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1:40 PM talks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/54/"&gt;You can be a speaker at PyCon!&lt;/a&gt; (Anna Ravenscroft, Lynn Root) - PyCon loves new blood. Get some pointers on how to get your talks ready for submission next year!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pm-talk"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1:55 PM talk&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/40/"&gt;Twisted Logic&lt;/a&gt; (Ashwini Oruganti) - Twisted is a mature, stable asynchronous framework written in Python that's been around for over a decade. New to the framework, the presenter explains why you shouldn't be scared of Twisted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="id3"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2:35 PM talks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This slot is going to be hard because all three beginner talks are things you don't want to miss!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/76/"&gt;Loop like a native: while, for, iterators, generators&lt;/a&gt; (Ned Batchelder) - One of the really awesome features of Python is that you can write custom looping classes. Factor in generators and you'll be amazed by one of Python's most powerful features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/112/"&gt;Visualizing Github, Part I: Data to Information&lt;/a&gt; (Dana Bauer, Idan Gazit) - How can you go wrong with visualizing GitHub data using Python? This first part of the talk is on gathering and processing of data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/145/"&gt;Encapsulation with descriptors&lt;/a&gt; (Luciano Ramalho) - Python has no private fields, but the property decorator lets you replace public attributes with getters and setters without breaking client code. It's amazing what Python can do when you delve into it's subtleties!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="id4"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3:15 PM talk&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/136/"&gt;Music Theory and Performance Analysis with Sebastian and Czerny&lt;/a&gt; (James Tauber) - An amazing speaker talking about one of his favorite subjects, this will be a great beginner talk. James mentored me in my early days of Django and JQuery, and I only have good things to say about him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/108/"&gt;Visualizing Github, Part II: Information to Meaning&lt;/a&gt; (Idan Gazit, Dana Bauer) - How can you go wrong with visualizing GitHub data using Python? This second part of the talk is on visualizing the data into something meaningful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="id5"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4:15 PM talks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/126/"&gt;Transforming Code into Beautiful, Idiomatic Python&lt;/a&gt; (Raymond Hettinger) - This is the talk that's going to bring down the house, because Raymond covers the basics in such a way that even the most advanced developers pick up new tricks. This talk will be standing room only, filled with beginners to the most senior developers on the planet. Get to this one early or you'll miss it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/118/"&gt;Deploy your Python app in 5 min with a PaaS&lt;/a&gt; (Nate Aune) - Long time presenter Nate Aune doesn't just explain and demonstrate various Platforms as a Service, he also gives tips on evaluating which one is best for your needs.

We believe it's our civic duty to document our work on private and public projects. Brian explains why this is so and how to get across the concepts of your work in the best way possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="talks"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5:10 talks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Part III&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for Part III of this series where I cover the second day of talks best suited for new Python developers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</summary><category term="python"></category><category term="django"></category><category term="audrey"></category><category term="pycon"></category><category term="pycon-2013-guide"></category></entry><entry><title>Beginner's Guide to PyCon 2013 Part I</title><link href="http://pydanny.com/beginners-guide-pycon-2013-part-1.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-01-22T16:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Daniel-Roy-Greenfeld</name></author><id>tag:pydanny.com,2013-01-22:beginners-guide-pycon-2013-part-1.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;New to Python and thinking about going to the upcoming &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/"&gt;PyCon US&lt;/a&gt; for the first time? You know, that big &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://python.org"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; conference taking place near San Francisco in March?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps you signed up already and are getting worried about being overwhelmed by hundreds of tutorials, talks, and activities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No worries! This multi-part guide will aid you in getting the most out of attending one of the best technical conferences on the planet. I'm going to share how to get through the whole event in good shape and cover some incredible beginner friendly events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-basics"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Basics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/registration/register/"&gt;register&lt;/a&gt; already! PyCon US sold out last year around this time. Don't be left out in the cold. Buy your ticket now before it's too late!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you've got that done, keep in mind that Python has two days of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/tutorials/"&gt;tutorials&lt;/a&gt;, three days of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/talks/"&gt;talks&lt;/a&gt;, and four days of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/community/sprints/"&gt;sprints&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Nine days of Python!&lt;/strong&gt; The trick is to not get exhausted or sick. Therefore, do the following every day of the conference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take at least one shower. Please.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat at least two good meals. Make a point of sitting with different people at each meal and introducing yourself. Make new friends!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get at least three hours of sleep. More if possible because your brain is going to go into learning overdrive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, PyCon US also has a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/about/code-of-conduct/"&gt;code of conduct&lt;/a&gt;. I like to sum it up as, &amp;quot;Act professionally.&amp;quot; Whether or not you agree with codes of conduct for conferences, PyCon US has one and it will be enforced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, enough basics, let's get onto tutorials!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tutorials"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tutorials&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tutorials take place on March 13th and 14th. They each cost $150 but are well worth the price. The following are the talks I believe are best suited for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="wednesday-morning"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wednesday Morning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For novice programmers start with Jessica McKellar's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/1/"&gt;A hands-on introduction to Python for beginning programmers&lt;/a&gt;. I can vouch that the instructor is amazing, and will jumpstart you on the road to being a Python developer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you an experienced developer new to Python? I suggest &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/8/"&gt;Going from web pages to web apps with Python&lt;/a&gt; by Asheesh Loroia and Karen Rustad. In 2009 I took a class by Asheesh and was impressed by his energy, enthusiasm, and depth of knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Want to learn Python web that isn't Django? Try out Paul Everitt's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/12/"&gt;Pyramid for Humans&lt;/a&gt; class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="wednesday-afternoon"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wednesday Afternoon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You simply can't go wrong with David Beazley's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/2/"&gt;Learn Python Through Public Data Hacking&lt;/a&gt;. He's the author of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Python-Essential-Reference-4th-Edition/dp/0672329786/?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=ihpydanny-20"&gt;Python Essential Reference&lt;/a&gt;, an amazing instructor, and delivered a PyCon keynote last year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're interested in the web, check out Nathan Yergler's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/9/"&gt;Effective Django&lt;/a&gt;. I can assure you that he knows his Django material and is going to deliver a great experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="thursday-morning"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Thursday Morning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're new to Python, you need to learn the Python environment. This means version control, PyPI, test automation, and more. Matt Harrison covers this in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/3/"&gt;Scripting: from Hard-drive to Github to PyPI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting back to the web, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/10/"&gt;Fully Test-Driven Web Development with Django and Selenium&lt;/a&gt; is another run through the Django tutorial, but done from the test driven perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fascinating tutorial offered at this time is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/30/"&gt;A Gentle Introduction to Computer Vision&lt;/a&gt;. It's a great way to learn how Python is used in many creative and unexpected ways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="thursday-afternoon"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Thursday Afternoon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jessica McKellar returns to instruct on how to give back to the community with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/4/"&gt;Contribute with me! Getting started with open source development&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Want to learn how to program games? Look no further than Richard Jones' &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/19/"&gt;Introduction to PyGame&lt;/a&gt;. He's taught this class for years, and I can't say enough good things about him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This talk is not meant for beginning Django developers, but it's useful anyway. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://gettingstartedwithdjango.com/"&gt;Kenneth Love&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jacobian.org"&gt;Jacob Kaplan-Moss&lt;/a&gt; are presenting &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/11/"&gt;Wiring Up Django Packages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The launch of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://django.2scoops.org"&gt;Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.5&lt;/a&gt; book has gone pretty well. The response has been almost entirely positive and sales have been pretty brisk. We've gotten a ton of great, constructive editorial feedback, which we're sorting through as we race towards the BETA release. Here are answers to the commonly asked questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="when-can-i-buy-the-book-via-paypal"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When can I buy the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://django.2scoops.org"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; via PayPal?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will support PayPal in either the BETA or FINAL release of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to handle PayPal we need to find a reputable e-publisher that supports it that gives us similar rates, customer service, and product control (updates at any time, uploads of PDF, no surprise charges, etc) as &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://gumroad.com"&gt;Gumroad&lt;/a&gt;. If you know of an e-publisher who is willing to provide that same level of service, please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record, we aren't leaving &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://gumroad.com"&gt;Gumroad&lt;/a&gt;. We just want to support developers and students who don't have credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;note:&lt;/strong&gt; While we could certainly write our own publishing platform, that would delay work on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://django.2scoops.org"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="when-can-i-get-a-kindle-mobi-or-epub-version"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When can I get a Kindle (mobi) or ePub version?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our plan is to support those formats in either the BETA or FINAL releases. In fact, I really love my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007HCCNJU/?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=ihpydanny-20"&gt;Kindle&lt;/a&gt;. I can't wait to proof my own &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://django.2scoops.org"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; on my favorite reading device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="when-can-i-get-a-print-version"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When can I get a print version?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope to have a print version in about 30 days. We need to ensure that the cover and layout actually looks nice, and that involves ordering copies from the Lulu, CreateSpace, whatever and reviewing them and making corrections. Then ordering again to make sure the corrections look okay. That simply takes a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are hoping for a mid-February release. Also, keep in mind we aren't sure yet if we'll do a print version of anything but a FINAL release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="when-are-the-beta-and-final-releases"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When are the BETA and FINAL releases?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can't make promises, but at the latest, the FINAL &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be done by the start of March so people have them in hand at PyCon US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="is-this-book-going-to-get-updated"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is this book going to get updated?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, we've already sent out three minor updates for grammar and spelling issues, and some bug fixes.  Even after the FINAL version comes out, we'll continue to update the book. One of the advantages of self-published books is we have control of content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-much-work-went-into-the-book"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How much work went into the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://django.2scoops.org"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://audreymroy.com"&gt;Audrey&lt;/a&gt; and I put in hundreds of hours writing and testing the content. We worked 12-16 hour days for weeks. It was madness, but a glorious madness. We became like hermits and toiled on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://django.2scoops.org"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; while ignoring distractions like sleep, food and consistent exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our amazing technical reviewers also worked very hard to provide us with critical commentary, advice and corrections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="where-should-i-send-errata"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where should I send errata?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please send errata to &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:2scoops&amp;#64;cartwheelweb.com"&gt;2scoops&amp;#64;cartwheelweb.com&lt;/a&gt;. The first person who reports an issue or makes a suggestion that we adopt will receive credit in the book. If not in the changelog, then in the dialogue of the book itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="are-you-going-to-pycon-us"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Are you going to PyCon US?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely! Wouldn't miss &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/"&gt;PyCon US&lt;/a&gt; for the world! &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://audreymroy.com"&gt;Audrey&lt;/a&gt; and I met and fell in love at PyCon US 2010! We'll be there for at least the second day of  tutorials, all the talks, and all the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/community/sprints/"&gt;sprints&lt;/a&gt;. I've even got a blog post coming that should serve as a guide for beginning Python and Django developers attending the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shameless Plug:&lt;/em&gt; We're both speaking and giving a tutorial. Sign up for the tutorial or attend our talks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="wiring-up-django-packages-tutorial"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/11/"&gt;Wiring Up Django Packages&lt;/a&gt; (Tutorial)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You just finished the Django tutorial. What do you do now? You wire in Django Packages! Django is part of an ecosphere of over 20,000 packages, which can be leveraged to great effect. This tutorial will teach the evaluation, use, and extension of third party Python and Django applications in your projects. This tutorial will be a lecture with a lot of detailed and annotated code examples. Instructors are &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://audreymroy.com"&gt;Audrey Roy&lt;/a&gt;, Daniel Greenfeld, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://brack3t.com/"&gt;Kenneth Love&lt;/a&gt; (of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://gettingstartedwithdjango.com/"&gt;Getting Started with Django&lt;/a&gt; fame).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="advanced-django-forms-usage-talk"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/101/"&gt;Advanced Django Forms Usage&lt;/a&gt;  (Talk)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Django forms are really powerful but there are edge cases, especially with class based views), that can cause a bit of anguish. This talk will go over how to handle many common solutions not currently described in the core documentation. It will also cover useful third-party libraries. Speaker is Daniel Greenfeld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="using-python-to-generate-art-and-sound-talk"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/58/"&gt;Using Python To Generate Art And Sound&lt;/a&gt; (Talk)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick to navigating the overwhelming Python audio/imaging landscape is understanding how the fundamentals work, using common data processing/visualization libraries, in-depth code samples, and simple math operations. I use the stdlib, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, PIL, and PyCairo to create building blocks, which I then combine to demonstrate advanced sound and image generation techniques. Speaker is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://audreymroy.com"&gt;Audrey Roy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="are-you-going-to-django-circus"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Are you going to Django Circus?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope so. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://2013.djangocon.eu/"&gt;Django Circus&lt;/a&gt;, a.k.a. DjangoCon Europe, is one of the important industry events for us and we're trying to figure out logistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our problem is that 2012 was a very hard year - the majority of our clients have not paid for the work that we did. Collecting is turning out to be extremely difficult, time consuming, and unpleasant. This is impacting everything we want to do in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-does-the-alpha-work"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does the ALPHA work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ALPHA is a preview version that we are selling at an introductory price of $12. When you purchase the ALPHA, you get access to the BETA and FINAL versions when they are released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you're wondering, we are planning to increase the price of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://django.2scoops.org"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; when we release the BETA and FINAL versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

We need more talk and tutorial submissions. Talks are 30 or 45 minute efforts in front of the PyCon audience and are recorded for posterity. Tutorials are three hours long and are given to attendees who have paid an additional fee in order to slurp in knowledge from the masters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 3 hour tutorial side of things, &lt;strong&gt;we especially need more Intro to Python level submission&lt;/strong&gt;. That means getting beginners up to speed on basic Python techniques, so they can then exploit the other tutorials, conference, and sprints to their full advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="now-onto-some-questions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Now onto some questions...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="i-would-like-to-give-a-tutorial-but-it-s-so-much-work-to-put-together-3-hours-of-quality-content"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. I would like to give a tutorial but it's so much work to put together 3 hours of quality content.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organizers of PyCon recognize that putting together a quality tutorial is an amazing amount of work. Which is why tutorial presenters are compensated for their effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-is-the-most-likely-length-talk-to-be-accepted-30-minutes-or-45-minutes"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. What is the most likely length talk to be accepted? 30 minutes or 45 minutes?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of PyCon sessions are 30 minutes long, so 45 minute slots are rare and valuable commodities. So if your talk needs to be 45 minutes long your  proposal has to really speak to the PyCon talk reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only that, if reviewers send you information requests for any duration talk or tutorial, &lt;strong&gt;you dramatically increase your odds of talk acceptance with timely responses&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, as said before, PyCon really needs more &lt;strong&gt;introductory level Python tutorial&lt;/strong&gt; submissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="i-would-like-to-present-a-talk-or-tutorial-but-i-can-t-afford-to-come-to-pycon"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. I would like to present a talk or tutorial but I can't afford to come to PyCon.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyCon's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?fromEmail=true&amp;amp;formkey=dGt4Z0dsY052VERJem4xUUFVQW9uQVE6MQ"&gt;financial aid program&lt;/a&gt; is said to favor accepted speakers to PyCon. They really want you to come!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="i-would-like-to-present-but-i-can-t-come-up-with-a-good-idea"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. I would like to present but I can't come up with a good idea!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had this problem as well! Then I looked at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/tutorials/suggested_topics_2012/"&gt;Suggested Tutorial Topics&lt;/a&gt; and got some ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ack-i-ve-got-a-talk-idea-but-it-s-going-to-take-me-too-much-time-to-put-it-together"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Ack! I've got a talk idea but it's going to take me too much time to put it together!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Submit the talk anyway before the talk and in fields you aren't ready to fill in, simply put '&lt;strong&gt;TBD&lt;/strong&gt;'. Then over the course of the next few days replace TBD with real material. Don't wait too long though to fix those TBDs, no more than a week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="i-m-a-beginner-nobody-in-the-community-is-there-any-chance-my-proposal-will-get-accepted"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. I'm a beginner/nobody in the community, is there any chance my proposal will get accepted?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absolutely!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PyCon talk/tutorial reviewers love to see new people present. While experienced/proven speakers have an edge, good talk/tutorial proposals from promising candidates &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; make it into the conference. Carefully double-check your submission, be responsive to reviewers, and stay positive. I'm not saying you will get in, but I am saying it's worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="good-luck"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good luck!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyCon 2013 is going to be bigger and better than any previous year. That's because we pull together as a community to run an amazing event that is known to jumpstart careers and cause amazing life changes. We can't do this without you, so hurry up on your &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/speaking/cfp/"&gt;PyCon US 2013 submissions&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

Here is my meme submission:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="python-obfuscation-contest"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Python Obfuscation Contest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;certain-to-be-controversial talk idea&lt;/strong&gt; would be where the speaker would solicit Pythonistas to submit a single arcane &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://python.org"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; code module that would have to display the text of &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; There would be a '&lt;em&gt;Expert&lt;/em&gt;' category which would forbid the eval/exec functions. The &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Anything Goes Category&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; would allow use of &lt;strong&gt;eval/exec&lt;/strong&gt;. The conference talk would be where the speaker announces the winners and comments on the brilliant insanity of submissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="python-in-space"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Python in Space!!!!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to hear any talk on how Python is used in space exploration or research. That includes NASA, SpaceX, ESA staffers or citizen scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="template-language-shootout"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Template Language Shootout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want a benchmark heavy talk on the raw speed of various Python template systems, complete with hard numbers and pretty charts. This isn't just a matter of speed, but also a measure of terseness and total usage. The test code will need to be made public so it can be vetted, debated, and expanded upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="python-3-from-scratch"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Python 3 from scratch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to see a talk that shows how by using Python 3 from the start, you content that you got a edge over Python 2.x. This case study should be as technical as possible and shouldn't have anything do with migrating from 2.x to 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="fun-and-games-with-numpy"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Fun and games with NumPy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://numpy.scipy.org/"&gt;NumPy&lt;/a&gt; is an incredible library. It deserves a talk, specifically one where it is demonstrated to do something amazing. Maybe it's something scientific, maybe it's something crunching social data, maybe it's something I can't begin to imagine. Surprise and impress me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you go, my submission of 5 talks to the &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013"&gt;PyCon 2013&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;talks/tutorials I'd like to see&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; meme. What do you want to see?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now it's time for...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-public-service-message-to-the-python-community"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Public Service Message to the Python Community&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi, I'm Daniel Greenfeld. You might know me from my &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pydanny.com"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. I'm here to talk to you about a very import subject: &lt;strong&gt;Submit your talk early to PyCon US.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year there were hundreds of talks submitted for just a very few speaking slots. Unpaid volunteers labored for hours before and after their normal jobs reviewing and debating which talks were to get in. The volume of talks combined with simple reviewer fatigue means that earlier submitted talks get more attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't leave your poor talk or tutorial out in the cold. Help us fix the problem in one of two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/speaking/cfp"&gt;Submit your talk as early as possible&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

My unofficial estimate is that we had about 90% of the attendees from the first day attend (with the unfortunate exception of most of the faculty and students of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.13hq.com/"&gt;Agoo Computer College&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day started with...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="lightning-talks"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lightning Talks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I don't normally take notes on lightning talks. I'm kicking myself now. &lt;strong&gt;Really hard.&lt;/strong&gt; I'll try and relate some of the talks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Import this and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/that"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt;, a parody talk by Daniel Greenfeld (me). &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/malcolmt/status/219244338029412352"&gt;Malcolm comment on it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting into space using weather balloons by Frank Pohlmann&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/audreyr/ponystrap"&gt;Ponystrap&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://audreymroy.com"&gt;Audrey Roy&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://klewel.com/conferences/djangocon-2012/index.php?talkID=31"&gt;video from DjangoCon Europe&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call for &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagalog"&gt;Tagalog&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_languages"&gt;Philippine languages&lt;/a&gt; translation of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://djangoproject.com"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt; by Malcolm Tredinnick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The obligatory PyCon lighting talk on Vim by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/bry_bibat"&gt;Bryan Bibat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://openerp.com/"&gt;OpenERP&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/PliniusSecundus"&gt;Frank&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.auberonsolutions.com/"&gt;Pohlmann&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ann-tan-pohlmann/4/a30/233"&gt;Ann Tan-Pohlmann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A parody talk by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/mrvaldez"&gt;Sony Valdez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it was on to...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="sprints-and-tutorials"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sprints and Tutorials&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encouraged at #pyconph seeing so many people declaring themselves beginners and then diving in. Enthusiasm was a bit contagious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/malcolmt"&gt;Malcolm Tredinnick&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/malcolmt/status/219425413301157889"&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary funding for the sprints came from the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation"&gt;Django Software Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pythonsprints.com/"&gt;Python Sprints&lt;/a&gt;. That funding went towards food, drinks, and various logistics for handling the estimated 200+ attendee turnout.  Things sprinted on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="id1"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Django&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Django had it's own dedicated and very full room (no more chairs could fit so I sat on the floor), with Malcolm Tredinnick leading the effort, with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://marconijr.com/"&gt;Marconi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/marconimjr"&gt;Moreto&lt;/a&gt; helping out. It turned into mostly an effort to get a lot of people kick-started in Django. What was very heartening was watching people race through the tutorials on their own, and then work on projects using the framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect next year the sprints will see a lot of submissions to Django core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had hoped to continue my work on Class Based View documentation, but it was wisely pointed out that I should focus more on helping others get moving in Django and other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ansible"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ansible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://capsunlock.net"&gt;Rodney&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cocoy"&gt;Quillo&lt;/a&gt; led the sprint on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ansible.github.com/"&gt;Ansible&lt;/a&gt; tool of which he is so fond. About seven people fond of engineering joined him. They seemed very productive and happy by day's end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pymongo"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;pymongo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of developers working on embedded devices gathered to work out an edge case issue with pymongo. I wish I knew more about their efforts, but I can tell you that this sort of very serious engineering effort is very common amongst professional Filipino developers. Because of geography, telecommunications and embedded devices are much more prevalent in the island nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="other-efforts"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other efforts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again I'm kicking myself. There were a ton of other development going on and I didn't document any of it. Certainly I was busy here and there helping out, but this is the sort of thing you need to document at the moment. Next time I assure you I will be very diligent about recording the efforts of so many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tutorial-room"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tutorial Room&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About half the people stayed in what I dubbed the tutorial room. This is where speakers took turns going over material we had brought to the conference. Attendees followed along, and the diligence and focus in the room was very impressive. The tutorials/talks included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intro to Python using Turtle by Sony Valdez&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction to git and github by Bryan Bibat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.slideshare.net/pydanny/intro-to-python-11186202"&gt;21 Cool Things You Can Do With Python&lt;/a&gt; by Daniel Greenfeld (me)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="food-and-drinks"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food and drinks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean to mention that the breakfast, lunch, and snacks at PyCon Philippines 2012 were pretty good. The logistic chairs had decided rather than gamble on the usual sort of over-priced and not-so-good professional catering service that most conferences rely on to the dismay of... well... everyone, to go with local restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For dinner people went out on their own. We were lucky enough to go to Pino in Quezon City both times. The Kare-Kareng Bagnet was really tasty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conference-end"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conference End&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference chair, Frank Pohlmann, gave us a few well spoken words about how wonderful the event was to run and host. How gratifying it was to see the enthusiasm and dedication of the attendees, and how inspired he felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we cheered him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that it was a lot of pictures and goodbyes to many new friends. Which meant a lot of sad feelings about a great event coming to an end. I felt inspired and changed. I wasn't the same person going in as I was coming out. I'm more grateful for what I have, and deeply honored that I had this chance to bring PyCon to so many wonderful people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More thoughts on PyCon Philippines in a forthcoming blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="coming-soon"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coming soon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can assure you that PyCon PH was an wonderful, amazing, humbling experience. I'm hoping that this post and others will get across to you why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="arrival"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Arrival&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank Pohlmann, chairman of PyCon Philippines picked us up and drove us to the event. He had worked day and night getting the event ready, all the while running his company, working a job, and being a father to his lovely 21 month old daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we arrived at the venue, Audrey and I were met by our good friend, Filipino-American Bryan Veloso of Github, who was to provide the closing keynote. As soon as Bryan heard that there was going to be a PyCon in the Philippines he gave up his trip to Europython to be a speaker at PyCon PH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, we were greeted Ann Tan-Pohlman, logistics co-chair and volunteer organizer. She had over a dozen volunteers getting ready for the oncoming flood of registrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More on the herculean efforts of the organizers and volunteers of this event in a forthcoming blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="inspiration"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inspiration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We noticed a large group gather by a side corridor and went to say hello. There we met &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/mrvaldez"&gt;Sony Valdez&lt;/a&gt;, President of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.13hq.com/"&gt;Agoo Computer College&lt;/a&gt;, and forty of his faculty and students. They were buzzing with energy and excitement, belying the fact that they had left at midnight the night before in order to arrive on time (they traveled many hours by bus). Audrey, Bryan, and I were floored by their effort to educate themselves, and were determined in our speeches not to disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the majority of the Agoo Computer Science had to go in the middle of the afternoon. &lt;strong&gt;We didn't know they had to go until it was time to leave&lt;/strong&gt;. Next year I plan to do whatever is possible to help them come for the duration of the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pycon-begins"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PyCon Begins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the national anthem, the Dean of Computer Science, Adrian Roy Valdez, started the event with a few words. Frank Pohlmann, PyCon PH chair thanked everyone involved including the sponsors, speakers, and especially the attendees. I gave a keynote speech I'll blog about shortly, and then it was time for the talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="intro-to-python-1"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Intro to Python &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id10" id="id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/titopao"&gt;Paolo Barazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulo gave the Intro to Python talk. He was burdened by some equipment issues, but kept going undeterred. It reminded me of the first time I spoke at PyCon 2010, when for the first 10 minutes of my talk they couldn't get the projector to work. In any case, Paolo did a great job under very trying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="python-tricks-you-can-t-live-without-2"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Python Tricks you can't live without &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id11" id="id2"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://audreymroy.com"&gt;Audrey Roy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audrey summarized a lot of the really important things you need to know in Python but aren't part of an introductory talk. Things like pip and virtualenv, how to construct packages, basic use of PyPI, and hammered home the need for good documentation. I may be partial, but I think this was the best version of this kind of talk ever given. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="django-quickstart-3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Django Quickstart &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id12" id="id3"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://marconijr.com/"&gt;Marconi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/marconimjr"&gt;Moreto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marconi built off what Audrey provided, and added to it by giving a good introduction to Django. He also contributed a lot during the sprints the next day by pitching in with beginners. His talk featured code for a simple TODO app, and you can see the working example at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://quickstart.marconijr.com/"&gt;http://quickstart.marconijr.com/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="game-programming-with-python-4"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Game Programming with Python  &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id13" id="id4"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you afraid of math? Too bad! In this tutorial you will learn how to math! Scary, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;&amp;mdash;Sony Valdez&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony Valdez, who I mentioned earlier, gave a talk on pygame and math while wearing the Barong Talalog. Not just any talk on pygame, but the best one I've ever seen. He's a natural speaker and educator, and extremely funny. And while giving this amazing talk on no sleep (remember - he was on a bus with 40 of his students and faculty), he broke many classic presenter rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Live code demo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wrote a functioning game while giving this talk. He made his mistakes part of the talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Used notepad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right. He didn't use Vim, Emacs, Sublime Text, or PyCharm. He used notepad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Someone else's laptop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He used an unfamiliar computer for his talk. Ever try and type on a keyboard you aren't familiar with? This is what he was dealing with while after a 5+ hour bus journey with probably no sleep the night before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm in awe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="functional-programming-in-python-5"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Functional Programming in Python  &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id14" id="id5"&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/malcolmt"&gt;Malcolm Tredinnick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony was a hard act to follow, but Malcolm gave an amazing rendition of his classic talk on functional programming. I've seen Malcolm give this talk before, but this instance was clearly the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ansible-6"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ansible &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id15" id="id6"&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://capsunlock.net"&gt;Rodney&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cocoy"&gt;Quillo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's a python conference without one talk about system engineering? Fortunately for us, Rodney gave a talk on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ansible.github.com/"&gt;Ansible&lt;/a&gt;, a pretty new Python based deployment tool. What makes Ansible different is it's range of options, and simplicity of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="i-didn-t-know-it-s-python-python-advocacy-7"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I didn't know it's Python: Python Advocacy &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id16" id="id7"&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;PyCon: More fun in the Philippines&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;&amp;mdash;Variant of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.itsmorefuninthephilippines.com/"&gt;Philippines Department of Tourism slogan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulo Barazon returned to talk about the big users of Python, how to promote it's use, and why it's so awesome for... well.. lots of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="maps-of-imaginary-lands-8"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Maps of Imaginary Lands &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id17" id="id8"&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malcom came back to give us a talk on how to assemble the components necessary to do a mashup of an imaginary place he cooked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="closing-keynote-design-your-open-source-project-9"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Closing Keynote: Design your open source project &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#id18" id="id9"&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/bryanveloso"&gt;Bryan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://avalonstar.com/"&gt;Veloso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bryan closed out the day with an inspirational and funny keynote speech instructing beginners on how to make your project used and loved by developers. His slides were incredible, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://speakerdeck.com/u/bryan/p/design-your-own-open-source-project"&gt;as you should see for yourself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

PyCon is a volunteer run effort that brings together Python developers from a variety of backgrounds and skill levels into a friendly, cooperative environment in order to educate, inspire, and work together - building relationships that transcend the event and can turn into lifelong friendships or even very impressive business alliances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event is possible due to the hard work and contributions of members of the Manila Python users group, the support of the Python Software Foundation, various members of the Python community, our gracious sponsors, and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be there, along with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://audreymroy.com"&gt;Audrey Roy&lt;/a&gt; and Django core developer &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/malcolmt"&gt;Malcolm Tredinnick&lt;/a&gt;. Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-is-python"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is Python?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://python.org"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; is an open source programming language used for science, engineering, robotics, entertainment, web development, and more. It is used by organizations such as Google, NASA, Instagram, Pinterest, Mozilla, Walt Disney Animation Studios, WETA Digital, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="interested-in-attending"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interested in attending?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then head to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ph.pycon.org/register.html"&gt;registration page&lt;/a&gt;. The early bird discount ends on June 15th, so buy your tickets now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="interested-in-sponsoring"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interested in sponsoring?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please go to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ph.pycon.org/sponsor.html"&gt;sponsorship page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your sponsorship would go a long way towards making PyCon Philippines 2012 a memorable event. As this is an entirely volunteer-run event, 100% of funds go toward actual event costs: food, drinks, chairs, tables, signage, nametags, flyers, advertising, etc. Per custom with PyCons around the world, the organizers receive no payment for their efforts, and any funds left over will be either placed in a Philippine based non-profit corporation or donated back to the Python Software Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

It's a Python powered product comparison site that combines the best features of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://opencomparison.org"&gt;Open Comparison&lt;/a&gt;, Yelp, Consumer Reports, and Pinterest. We've worked day and night to make it better, with countless members of the Python community using the site and giving us invaluable feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of that brings us to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://us.pycon.org/2012/"&gt;PyCon&lt;/a&gt;. We're not just here as attendees and participants, but also to promote our startup.  It used to be the cool thing to launch your startup at SXSW, but times have changed. Now it's the cool thing to launch at PyCon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Twilio, Twitter, Facebook, and Google, we've got an &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://api.consumernotebook.com"&gt;API&lt;/a&gt; we want developers to use. And as an upcoming startup, we've got to really be creative in how we gain your attention, so here is what we're doing for PyCon 2012:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="demos-at-our-pycon-startup-row-booth"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Demos at our &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/community/openspaces/capoeira/"&gt;PyCon Startup Row&lt;/a&gt; booth.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks PyCon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've got a booth on Saturday. We've got banners and bright red track jackets. We're giving out handy API reference cards, as well as 10 different &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://consumernotebook.com/lists/audreyr/list-of-oreo-cookie-flavors/"&gt;flavors of Oreo cookies&lt;/a&gt; (see our site for a complete list of every Oreo cookie flavor, by the way).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So stop on by, sign up for the BETA, have a cookie, and talk to us about our API. For that matter, feel free to talk to me or Audrey about the API any time you see us. We're wearing bright red jackets with '&lt;strong&gt;Ask me about our API&lt;/strong&gt;' on our back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the API, the next item on our plan is...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-big-kickoff-api-contest"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. A big kickoff API contest.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've put together the Consumer Notebook &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://api.consumernotebook.com"&gt;API&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you get product list
and comparison data out of our site via a simple REST interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're kicking off our PyCon 2012 API launch with an &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://developers.consumernotebook.com/contest.html"&gt;API contest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have from now until April 22 to find new and exciting ways to use our &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://api.consumernotebook.com"&gt;API&lt;/a&gt;. If you win we'll give you a Kindle Fire or equivalent gift certificate valid in your nation of origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. We're hosting the Saturday night &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/community/openspaces/capoeira/"&gt;PyCon Capoeira Open Space&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to see some awesome Capoeira moves? Want to learn some of the basics? Want to just have fun?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've hired professional Hollywood stuntman and Capoeira instructor to the stars, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://valleycapoeira.com/?page_id=7"&gt;Contra Mestre Xingu&lt;/a&gt;, to come up from Los Angeles to lead this event. In addition to appearing in movies, videos, and commercials, he's got first hand experience with snakes. In his own words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capoeira saved my life. What? How? Well it was a sunny afternoon, I was shooting a film in the Hollywood hills off Coldwater Canyon at a house. I was running back to set from the bathroom and out of nowhere a rattlesnake jumped up from the ground and tried to bite me. I quickly jumped out of the way and did a fast negative &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_capoeira_techniques#Rol.C3.AA"&gt;rolé&lt;/a&gt; away from the snake. Then I called the other people on set and we caught it. I really didn't think much of it afterwards until after the shoot. My friend told me the rattlesnake was a young one and I'm lucky I didn't get bitten.  When a younger rattler bites you, it usually unloads all of it's venom in you because it cannot control the amount it releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;&amp;mdash;Contra Mestre Xingu&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 30 people have signed up up for this event, including Python core developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
When: Saturday, 8pm - 10pm
What to bring: Camera!
What to bring if you are participating: Workout clothes, water bottle
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was terribly excited for her to get that invitation, and that excitement was compounded when they allowed me to present on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.slideshare.net/pydanny/confessions-of-a-joe-developer`:"&gt;Confessions of Joe Developer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travel is a passion of mine, and it's only been since 2007 that I've gotten a chance to do much seeing of the world. Australia was always this distant goal of mine, but I never thought I would get the chance to go. Fortunately, my assumption was wrong and we landed on August 18th in Sydney, Australia!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audrey &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://audreyr.posterous.com/thank-you-pycon-au"&gt;wrote her own statement about the event&lt;/a&gt; right after we were done. She's good that way. Okay then, off to my own review. This is belated, but better late then never, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conference-rooms"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conference Rooms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sydney Masonic Center was the venue and it was a really curious building. They built it a while ago, then apparently grafted an office building onto the top of the temple. &lt;strong&gt;You have to see it to believe it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main temple room was room, interesting, and fun. The acoustics, to my limited ear, seemed quite good. The alternative rooms for some of the tracks were small presentation rooms, which did quite nicely except when the organizers chose popular talks for small rooms and things overflowed. Everyone was good natured about that and we all just worked it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result: Great&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="speakers"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Speakers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm partial but I think the opening keynote by Audrey Roy about diversity was wonderful. Mary Gardinar also talk about open source projects trying to change the world that need our support. Raymond Hettiger seriously delivered the goods with another version of his amazing talk about what makes Python great. Whatever you do, go and see it as many times as possible because he changes it each and every time.  Richard Jones' presentation on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pydanny-event-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/PyconAU2011/zen_of_python.html"&gt;Zen of Python&lt;/a&gt; was very solid too, and I'll use this as an opportunity to promote my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/that"&gt;Anti-Zen of Python&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came time for me to present on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.slideshare.net/pydanny/confessions-of-a-joe-developer`:"&gt;Confessions of Joe Developer&lt;/a&gt;, I finished way too early; plus me and Audrey felt the talk was not technical enough. Even though the reception for my talk was very positive, based on that experience and observation we ramped up the technical content for DjangoCon US and I delivered a much stronger talk. I want to thank the Australian Python community for being a wonderful audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pydanny-event-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/PyconAU2011/index.html"&gt;rest of the talks I saw were all quite good&lt;/a&gt;, in fact the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pydanny-event-notes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/PyconAU2011/decorators.html"&gt;one on decorators&lt;/a&gt; was incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result: Super&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conference-meals"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conference Meals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The night before the conference, Frends/mentors Russell Keith-Magee and Malcolm Tredennick took me to a sushi-train place and we gobbled down some very nice raw seafood. Call me silly, but sushi on moving plates just tastes better! Thanks guys!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In between talks they served nice little sandwiches. The coffee bar had lovely Flat Whites and considering the quality of dairy in Australia I was very happy with the break food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first night of the conference they served an amazing, amazing meal. The lamb was like nothing I've tasted before - my best way of describing it was &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;so this is how lamb is supposed to taste&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;. We also got served Pavlova, which Audrey really enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last evening of the conference we went out to a famous Sydney gastropub/brewery and got kangaroo and crocodile pizza. The kangaroo was outstanding, but the alligator wasn't my thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the conference we went with Graham Dumpleton to a wonderful Dim Sum place and I stuffed myself silly while Audrey quizzed Graham on WSGI. I was sleepy for the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pounds gained? Many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result: Superb&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="parties"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Parties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some lovely dinners and hang-outs. It was incredible putting faces to names and personalities. Everyone looked as I imagined, which meant they looked smashing. Events tended to be lower key, which can make for some wonderfully nice, cozy conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result: Good&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="accommodations"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Accommodations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no official conference hotel so we stayed at World Hotel - in easy walking distance of the conference center. It wasn't cheap, but I've learned from painful experience that when you travel to a conference, you want to spend your time at the conference, not going to-and-from a cheap hotel five miles away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The staff of the hotel were very nice and helpful. Unfortunately they were working around the limitations of their building. The rooms were really tiny and rather stuffy. Normally that isn't an issue since we spend a lot of our time outside the room, but in this case Audrey was polishing her talk and needed a quiet room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result: Average but not the fault of the conference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="sprints"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sprints&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked with Richard Jones about PyPI authentication issues, and he decided to go with OpenID. Personally, I would prefer OAUTH but I'll take whatever I can get. On the behalf of the community Mark Rees implemented OpenID on PyPI at the sprint so things like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://opencomparison.org"&gt;http://opencomparison.org&lt;/a&gt; can support the community better. One goal at PyCon 2012 is to get that working as another authentication system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise I closed bugs and worked lintification of the project. Audrey and a couple Australian PyLadies, Elena Williams and Jenny Nguyen, worked some core Django documentation tickets. We didn't get as much done as we hoped thanks to an outside distraction, but the organization of the sprints was top-notch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the sprint, those crazy Australians taught us how to do a &lt;strong&gt;Tim Tam Slam&lt;/strong&gt;. It's rather scary and not for the faint of heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result: Great&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="overall-result"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overall Result&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference was run professionally. The leadership was on the ball. The few issues that cropped up were taken care of, certainly better then what I would have done. Thank you everyone who put it together or just gave us a great time: Tim Ansell, Richard Jones, Nick Coghlan, Russell Keith McGee, Graham Dumpleton, Malcolm Tredennick and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia was amazing. The people were wonderful. I wish we had more time to go sightseeing and relax, but we were off all too quickly. I could write a book about the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combined Result: Great&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="wednesday-march-7th"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wednesday, March 7th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me and Audrey are driving up from Los Angeles. I've wanted to do this drive for a while, so this is very exciting. We'll arrive in the evening and hopefully tag up with friends old and new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="thursday-march-8th"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thursday, March 8th&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evening we'll be helping assemble bags for the conference. That's always a blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="friday-march-9th"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Friday, March 9th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyCon really begins! I'll be at the keynotes, and then the talks begin. These are some of the talks I'm really leaning towards watching:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/64/"&gt;Introduction to Metaclasses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/399/"&gt;The Art of Subclassing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, of course, is that all the talks look awesome. Missing some of these talks is going to hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening we're going to the New Relic/Loggly/Skull Candy party and hang out at the (in)famous TIP BOF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="saturday-march-10th"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Saturday, March 10th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://consumernotebook.com"&gt;Consumer Notebook&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pycon.blogspot.com/2012/02/startup-row-winners-for-pycon-2012.html"&gt;Startup Row&lt;/a&gt; booth all day! Come and hang out with us and all the other bright, new companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening I'm hosting the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/community/openspaces/capoeira/"&gt;PyCon Capoeira Open Space&lt;/a&gt;. We've got a seriously large room assigned for the event, and over twenty five people currently signed up to participate (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bit.ly/pycon-capoeira"&gt;there's still room for signups&lt;/a&gt;). Even if you don't want to play a musical instrument or learn/play at Capoeira, come anyway to watch. Some of the players there have some seriously amazing skills - I can assure you've seen them in the movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="sunday-march-11th"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sunday, March 11th&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More talks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/482/"&gt;Transifex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/301/"&gt;Sketching a better product&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/66/"&gt;Building A Python-Based Search Engine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/168/"&gt;Diversity in practice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="monday-march-12-thursday-march-15"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Monday March 12 - Thursday, March 15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprints! Nothing set in stone yet, but some ideas I've had include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch python.opencomparison.org for all of Python.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenComparison integration of PyPI OpenID, SourceForge OAUTH, and BitBucket OAUTH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved OpenComparison integration of the Launchpad API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement Gitorious API for OpenComparison.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement Text Based search for OpenComparison.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hack on Mongo related technologies such as django-mongonaut and some other planned projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

We submitted it to PyCon StartUp row and found out this morning we've been accepted. &lt;strong&gt;Hooray!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pycon.blogspot.com/2012/02/startup-row-winners-for-pycon-2012.html"&gt;PyCon StartUp Row winner's post&lt;/a&gt;, here is a little bit of what we're about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="highlights"&gt;
Have you tried researching products online recently? Search engines are gamed by scammy marketers. Product review sites overwhelm you with ads, have unreliable reviews, or dryly compare raw product specs. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://consumernotebook.com"&gt;Consumer Notebook&lt;/a&gt; is working to solve this problem. It is like Yelp for products, with product comparison grids inspired by the founders' open-source work on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://djangopackages.com"&gt;Django Packages&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://opencomparison.org"&gt;Open Comparison&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just so you know, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://us.pycon.org"&gt;PyCon&lt;/a&gt; in North America is the biggest gathering for the international Python community. The conference this year is in Santa Clara, California, and is sold-out at 1500+ attendees, but could have easily sold out several times that number. The talks, tutorials, and events are going to be incredible, and I'm delighted to be part of the PyCon experience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look forward to sharing the StartUp Row with friends like Transifex, Python Packages, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.weddinglovely.com/"&gt;Wedding Lovely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please check out &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://consumernotebook.com"&gt;Consumer Notebook&lt;/a&gt; right now and also visit our PyCon booth on Saturday, March 10th and we'll show you what we're doing.&lt;/p&gt;

I had been sitting next to my friend &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://djangrrl.com/"&gt;Barbara&lt;/a&gt; and we got up to go when I heard a feminine voice ask: &amp;quot;Are you &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/bshaurette"&gt;bshaurette&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;quot; I turned and it was like I got punched in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the first time I met &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://audreymroy.com"&gt;Audrey&lt;/a&gt;. I remember every detail of how she looked at that moment. The clothes she was wearing, the part in her hair, that her eyes met mine, and that they didn't turn away. I was immediately captivating, but fortunately remembered to act like a gentleman. I tossed in a casual invitation to her to join us for lunch, which I pulled off even though my heart was pounding. Thankfully she accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life has been pretty much awesome ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the day I met the love of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
