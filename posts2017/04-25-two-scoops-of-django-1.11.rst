When we started the Two Scoops of Django project back in 2012, I never thought it would become a book series. Well, it's turned into just that, and so I'm pleased to announce the "Early Release" or "BETA" release of the `Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.11`_ **PDF** ebook.

Co-authored with `Audrey Roy Greenfeld`_, the `1.11 edition`_ of *Two Scoops of Django* is filled to the brim with knowledge to help make Django projects better. We introduce various tips, tricks, patterns, code snippets, and techniques that we've picked up over the years. What we didn't know or weren't certain about, once again we found the best experts in the world and asked them for the answers. Then we packed the result into a 530+ page book.

What's Next?
=============

* We'll be adding more material to the 1.11 edition in the near future, hence the term, "`Early Release`_". Everyone who buys the 1.11 ebook_ from us gets all 1.11 ebook updates.
* Once we're happy with the ebook, we'll release a `print paperback edition`_, scheduled for May or June.
* We're selling the book in PDF format, as well as taking pre-orders for the print edition.
